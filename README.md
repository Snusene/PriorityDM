Bypass Do Not Disturb for DMs from specific people.

Like Emergency Bypass on iPhone, messages from selected contacts will always come through with sound and notification, regardless of your status.

**How to use**
- Right click any user
- Enable "Priority DM Notifications"
- Their DMs will now bypass Do Not Disturb
